values used for environment variables should not go into source code

Easiest way to set an env variable is when running the source code,
e.g. 'BROWSER=chrome npm run start open google' sets BROWSER=chrome and then runs.
    To get the variable in the code, write: const browser = process.env.BROWSER; 

You can also create a file '.env' in the root dir in this case: '/client'
    You should put .env into .gitignore
To read '.env' you need to 'npm install dotenv' and import dotenv from 'dotenv'

if you have 'BROWSER=safari' in '.env' and then run the code with 'BROWSER=chrome npm run start open google',
the env variable in the terminal will overwrite the one in '.env'
