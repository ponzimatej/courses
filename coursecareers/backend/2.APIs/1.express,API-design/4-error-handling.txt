USE try {} catch {}

400 status codes usually mean there's something wrong on the client side

500 status codes usually mean there's something wrong with the server
    basically means - 'website's broken, try again later'

If you don't use try catch, the client is going to show the error itself
    when in production, it will just say 'internal server error'

to see how something looks in production, you can just add a script that launches with
    NODE_ENV=production

    be careful when installing packages
