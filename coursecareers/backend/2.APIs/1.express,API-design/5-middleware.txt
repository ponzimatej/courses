app.use((req, res, next) => {})

to get to the next step, you have to call next() in the arrow function

for example you can make two 'get' functions for the same route: e.g 'localhost:3000/favorites'
    the first get function will take in (req, res, next) and at the end of this function, 
    you will call next(), this will then call the next 'get' function which can do something more
        e.g. the first function can process data and the second can return the data to the client

You can also call one 'get' function and pass in (<path>, fn1, fn2)
