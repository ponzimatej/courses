you can either do 
    import { x, y, z } from 'path'
    or
    import * as 'name' from 'path'
        this way you can call 'name'.'functionName' and it will use the function from the other file

you can also do
    import { getFavorites as get } from 'path'

when exporting, you can do
    export default { getFavorites, addFavorite, deleteFavorite }
        and import it with
    import SDK (or some other name) from 'path'
        then you can use the default exports such as getFavorites as SDK.getFavorites()
       
        you can also import from the file like this:
            import SDK, {replaceFavorites} from 'path'
        now you can access getFavorites, addFavorite and deleteFavorite as SDK.getFavorites and you can also access replaceFavorites()
