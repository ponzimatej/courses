you need to set CORS to let the fronted access the backend (if they are not at the same url)

CORS = Cross Origin Requests

CORS can be bypassed by using CORS Middleware, so its not the best security, its just a small part

DONT use online middleware, either make it yourself (node package cors anywhere) or just fix your CORS

you can set the CORS origin to only be your frontend, this way the backend shouldnt (in theory) be accessible by anything else
    you can also allow only chosen methods: e.g. GET and only chosen headers: e.g. 'content-type'
