typescript basically outputs javascript
    its just js with additional features and rules

typescript is recommended
    it prevents dumb mistakes in your code

'npm install -g typescript'
'tsc' <= typescript compiler
'tsc --version' etc.
when you run 'tsc "fileName"' it will convert the .ts file to a .js file, you can then run the .js file with node

created /api-ts for my API written in typescript
    installed some dev dependencies => 'npm install typescript ts-node nodemon @types/node --save-dev'
    dev dependencies because typescript is just used for development
    'npx tsc --init' creates config.json which has to do with configuring our TS project

TypeScript allows you to write modern JavaScript and then compile it to an old version of JavaScript
    this is good because older versions might have better compatibility

To make your JS code use 'import' you need to use ESModules
    in tsconfig.json find 'modules' and set it to 'ESNext' or sth else idk
    to be able to run the JS code with 'import', you need to go to package.json and add 'type': 'module'
